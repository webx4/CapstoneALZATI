# Developer's Guide
 Alzati World 
=================

Use this guide to work on **Alzati World** on your personal machine.

As always, _**please**_ make sure that you're working on a branch, not master. Confused about this? Let's get started.

_(Note that this developer's guide assumes that you're comfortable working with the terminal and terminal commands. If not, pull up a tutorial â€“ I recommend Tania Rascia's fantastic tutorial [linked here](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-use-the-command-line-for-apple-macos-and-linux/))_

Installing for the first time
-----------------------------

Clone the repo and `cd` into it.
